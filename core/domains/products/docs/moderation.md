# Product Moderation

## Purpose
Ensure product listings comply with platform policies and legal requirements.

## Moderation Triggers
- New product submission
- Product update affecting description or images
- User reports

## Outcomes
- Approved
- Rejected
- Requires changes

## Human-in-the-loop
Moderators may:
- Reject products
- Request changes
- Escalate for legal review

## Constraints
Moderation decisions do not directly modify domain state.
They produce events consumed by the Products domain.
